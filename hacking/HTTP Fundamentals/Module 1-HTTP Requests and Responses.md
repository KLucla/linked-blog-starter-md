 - An HTTP request is made by the client/ web browser, and is processed by the web server.
 - When the server receives the request, it responds with a HTTPS response containing the response code.

 - cURL
	 - If we wanted to view the full HTTP request and HTTP response using cURL, we can add -v for the verbose flag, e.g.  KLhcks@htb[/htb]$ curl inlanefreight.com. 
- Browser Dev Tools
	- Whenever we visit a website or access any web application, our browser sends multiple web requests and handles multiple HTTP responses to render the final result in the browser window.
	- F12 opens the browser web tools, and the Network tab is most useful.
