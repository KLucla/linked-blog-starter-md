- HTTP is a tool used to access the www resources.
	- HTTP communication consists of a client and a server, where the client requests the server for a resource. The server processes the requests and returns the requested resource
	- HTTP is Defaulted to port 80
- HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
- `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`)
- `Uniform Resource Locator` (`URL`)
-  DNS (Domain Name System)

- HTTP flow
	- User enters a URL into the browser
	- Browser sends request to DNS
	- DNS looks up IP from url, and returns it
		- Server cannot communicate without an IP address
	- Once browser receives IP address, sends a GET request to HTTP port
	- The web server receives the request and processes it
- CURL
	- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) (client URL) is a command-line tool and library that primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols.

	- If a client submits a http request to a https server, the server tries to communicate with port 80, then redirects to port 443 for https.
	- The client/web browser sends a "hello packet" which provides information about itself
	- After this, the server replies with "server hello", followed by a [key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange) to exchange SSL certificates.
		- SSL Certificate: a **digital certificate** that verifies the identity of a website and enables **secure, encrypted communication** between a web browser and the web server.
	- Client verifies the certificate, then sends its own key.
	- Finally an encrypted handshake is initiated to make sure everything is working properly
	- After all the steps, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is now encrypted
- NOTE: 
	- One way an intruder can bypass HTTPS is by performing a HTTP downgrade attack, which downgrades HTTPS communication to HTTP, and changes the data transferred to clear-text. This is done with a [[MITM]](Man in the Middle) technique.
